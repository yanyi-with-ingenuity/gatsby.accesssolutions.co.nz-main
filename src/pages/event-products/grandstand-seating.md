# Grandstand Seating

If you’re responsible for organising staging for a school, sporting or corporate event then Access Solutions is the company that should be first on your ‘to do’ list.

Staging can be provided in varying sizes - the advantage of using a concert stage provided by Access Solutions is that the product can be supplied in whatever configuration you need. The standard module of 1.66m wide x 2.5m long can be constructed in almost any arrangement.The basic height starts at 450mm and can be varied if required. Each stage has a sturdy, lightweight aluminium frame that clips together quickly and easily, utilises an anti-slip textured deck, and is strong, safe and looks great.

If needed, Access Solutions can also construct and provide any necessary accessories such as stairs up to the stage, PA stands, video surveillance towers or even roof structures over the stage to help make your function a success. Call the team on 0800 653 343 to discuss your event and Staging requirements.
