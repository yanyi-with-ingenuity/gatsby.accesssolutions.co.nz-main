# Forklifts / Telehandlers

Our Rough Terrain Forklifts are often used for event set up and dismantling scaffolding structures, pop up buildings or marquees. They have the capability to carry loads of up to 3.5T, across uneven terrain such as grass or gravel, and up to heights of 3m.

Telehandlers are also used for events when you are in a setting that requires an extendable boom to reach over or through spaces.

Call the team on 0800 653 343 to discuss your event and Forklift or Telehandler requirements.
