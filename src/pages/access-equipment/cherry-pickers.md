Access Solutions provides 2 models of Cherry Pickers – both have gasoline engines, use a trailer mounted articulating aerial work platform plus a jib boom for extra versatility and reach.

Both models have a high strength all steel base and utilise independently operated hydraulic outriggers for additional safety and stability. Speed controls are located at the platform and base for precise manoeuvring at the job site.
