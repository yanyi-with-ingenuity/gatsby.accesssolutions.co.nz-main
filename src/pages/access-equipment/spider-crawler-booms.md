With a complete range of narrow tracked spider lift access platforms, from 15m to 50 metres working height, we have the largest fleet of narrow tracked spider booms for hire in New Zealand.

Our new Spiderlifts (tracked knuckle booms) feature compact dimensions for getting into narrow spaces and doorways, plus specialised tracked chassis for low ground bearing pressure.

The tracked Spiderlift access platform is designed to go where other forms of Cherrypicker or Access Machine can not.

Call the team on 0800 653 343 to organise your next Spider Boom hire.
