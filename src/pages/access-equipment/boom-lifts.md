Access Solutions has more models and more choice in their extensive range of Boom Lifts including Diesel and Electric Knuckle Boom Lifts and Diesel Telescopic Boom Lifts.

Knuckle Boom Lifts provide precise platform positioning with pivots above or below horizontal of the main boom. This increases your horizontal work range, providing improved access in confined work areas and greater productivity. All our Knuckle Boom Lift models move effectively both on and off hard slab surfaces with positive traction on uneven surfaces. (Available in diesel or electric models).

The Telescopic Boom Lifts offered by Access Solutions are all top of the line with faster drive speeds, oscillating axles to ensure positive performance in the toughest and roughest conditions and aerial work platforms designed to reduce the time required for operator training. Easy to use controls ensure a safe and reliable working environment at all heights and in all weather conditions.

Call the team on 0800 653 343 to organise your next Boom Lift hire.
