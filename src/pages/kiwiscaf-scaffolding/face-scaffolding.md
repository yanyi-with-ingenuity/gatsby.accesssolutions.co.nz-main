# Face Scaffolding

![Kiwiscaf](/images/uploads/kiwiscaf.jpg)

Access Solutions’ Face Scaffolding is quick and easy to erect and clean to use.

The aluminium system is light – a necessity for verandahs and roofs, and its versatility is demonstrated in a wraparound system designed to let workers move around building corners without having to build 2 separate scaffolding structures.

All scaffolding systems are safe and stable, complying with Australia/New Zealand safety regulations.

Call the team on 0800 653 343 to discuss using Face Scaffolding for your project.
