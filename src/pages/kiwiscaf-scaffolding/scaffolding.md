Access Solutions offers a full range of KIWISCAF scaffolding products including versatile mobile or static towers. We also manufacture our own brand of face scaffolding and modular scaffolding systems for single bay towers to multiple linked bays. All products meet the highest safety requirements and are quick and easy to erect providing safe and fast access to work areas. Each scaffold comes complete with guardrails, toeboards, ladders and access platforms at the working level. We have a full range of scaffolding configurations to suit any specification.
Access Solutions also supplies a large range of scaffolding components such as castors, screw & swivel jacks and braces to add onto existing compatible scaffolds.
