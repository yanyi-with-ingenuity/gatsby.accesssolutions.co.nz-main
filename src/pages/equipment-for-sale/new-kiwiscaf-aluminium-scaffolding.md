* Avoid power lines (minimum clearance 4m . . . consult local electricity authority).
* Keep working platforms and landings clear of material and debris.
* Do not attach containment sheeting or banners to freestanding towers.
* Additional precautions should be taken to ensure stability of the tower in windy or gusty conditions.
* All couplers or fittings used must be compatible with 50.8mm O/D tude.
* Before using a Tower Scaffold always ensure that:
* The tower is level and all castor are locked.
* All frame legs are load-bearing and correctly seated on castor sleeves/screw jacks.
* Outriggers (where used) are correctly fitted and adjusted and bearing on a hard flat surface.

### When moving a Mobile Tower always ensure that:

* The scaffold is unoccupied and all items are removed or secured.
* All castors are unlocked and aligned in the direction of travel.
* Avoid slab edges and other step downs (minimum clearance approx. 1m).
* Always lock castor when finished . . . never leave a mobile tower unattended without locking the castors.
* Maintenance and Handling:
* Inspect all components for damage and/or wear before use.
* Do not use sub-standards components.
* Remove any build up of paint/plaster etc. (especially from brace ends and and castor/screw jacks threads).
* Avoid damage by: Handling scaffold carefully
* Transport and store neatly
* DO NOT over-tighten couplers
