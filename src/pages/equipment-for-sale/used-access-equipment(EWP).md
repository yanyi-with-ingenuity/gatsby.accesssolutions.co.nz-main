# Used Access Equipment (EWP)

To make room for new equipment Access Solutions offers customers the opportunity to buy – at a reduced cost – much of its ex-hire range.

The benefit to the customer is huge – a lower financial commitment than you would have to make if buying new, and the reassurance that the piece of equipment has been professionally maintained and serviced by Access Solutions after each job throughout its hire history.

All units listed below are ex Auckland and in good working order unless stated otherwise. Purchasing is on an ‘as is , where is’ basis.

As units are sold, we constantly update the list.

If you’re interested in a particular unit but it doesn’t look like we have it for sale at the moment give the team a call 0800 653 343 or e-mail info@accesssolutions.co.nz
