# Our History

Access Solutions was born from a company called Oldfield’s Access (a division of the Australian Oldfield's Group)

In the mid 1980’s an Australian company - Oldfield’s Access ( a division of the larger company - Oldfield’s Group) diversified their paint application product range to include aluminium/fibreglass ladders and scaffolding. By setting up a hire business throughout Australia and New Zealand, the company integrated the aluminium scaffolding product into the Australasian market.

Michael Biddick joined Oldfield’s Access as the NZ Manager in the late 80s and subsequently set out to grow the company by setting up the manufacturing of the aluminium scaffolding and taking over the position of General Manager of Oldfield’s Access Australasia in the mid 90s. It was at this time that Oldfield's Access introduced Elevated Work Platforms to their range.

By 2000, Michael successfully conducted a management buyout of Oldfield’s Access in NZ and Access Solutions was launched into the NZ market with an aluminium scaffold fleet, scaffold manufacturing and 17 elevated work platforms.

Over the next 10 years Access Solutions increased its EWP fleet to over 200 units and by 2012 had opened a Wellington office and extended into the South Office with a branch in Christchurch.

With the well established goal of being a quality supplier and offering a comprehensive range of access equipment to the access industry, diversifying into Forklifts was a very logical step for Access Solutions. So when the opportunity to purchase the Wellington operation of forklift supplier Powerlift Material Handing presented itself, Michael readily accepted it and extended his business to include the new sister company, Forklift Solutions.

In 2015 Access Solutions received the prestigious Gold Award in the Hire Excellence Awards from the Hire industry Association of New Zealand and today the company employs over 50 staff, has a nationwide business with over 900 EWPs and forklifts in the fleet.
